//! Seeded crash and restart fuzzing of the **mounted** observation journey
//! (`tdmem-5lc`).
//!
//! # What is under test, and why it is this mount
//!
//! The sibling driver in `tracedecay-memory-observation` kills the runtime
//! seam. What it cannot reach is the thing the product actually ships: the
//! journey the composition root mounts — [`mount_and_replay`] over
//! [`ProjectMemoryProviderComposition`], the registry delivery adapter, the
//! supervised readiness handshake, the recovery gate, the sanitizer, the
//! bounded provider call, and the live replay task. Every life here runs that
//! journey. Nothing in this file composes a runtime by hand, and the whole
//! module compiles only under `--features memory-provider-host`, which is the
//! build the mount exists in.
//!
//! # Where a life dies, and why no production hook exists for it
//!
//! Process death is injected at the two seams the *composition root itself*
//! hands the journey — the canonical observation store it replays from, and
//! the Native application port the provider composition dispatches to. Both
//! are production arguments, not test hooks: the mount takes an
//! `ObservationAdmissionPort` by value and a `NativeMemoryApplicationPort`
//! inside the composition, exactly as the daemon does. The journey itself is
//! untouched, and no `#[cfg(test)]` seam is compiled into it.
//!
//! | boundary the bead names | where this driver stands | what the parent proves after the kill |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | canonical commit → journal write | the store parks on the pass that would serve the target | the canonical log holds it and the journal has no row for it |
//! | journal write → dispatch | the provider parks inside the **delivery preflight handshake**, which the host performs before it builds the observation call | the journal row is durable and this life's provider-entry log never named the row's key |
//! | dispatch → provider effect | the provider parks on entry, after it has durably recorded that it was entered and before it touches its ledger | the entry log names the key and the ledger did not grow in this life |
//! | provider effect → answer exists | the provider parks after its effect is fsync'd and before the terminal is built | the ledger holds the key and the sealed-answer log does not |
//! | answer handed back → receipt persisted | a debug-only journal observer parks at entry to the host's `record_attempt`, after the provider call returned and before its receipt transaction starts | the sealed-answer log and the ledger hold the key and the journal holds no acknowledging receipt for it |
//! | acknowledgement persisted | a debug-only journal observer parks after the receipt transaction that makes the target's acknowledgement contiguous commits | receipt *and* acknowledged watermark are both durable |
//!
//! The fifth row uses the journal boundary the test owns. Before this child
//! mounts, it installs a debug-only observer on the journal that the real mount
//! opens. `record_attempt` invokes that observer after the bounded provider call
//! and terminal verification have returned to the host, but before the receipt
//! transaction starts. The provider's sealed-answer file proves the answer
//! existed; the observer proves host ownership of the seam; the parent then
//! verifies that no acknowledging receipt crossed it before the kill.
//!
//! The last row is the honest form of the bead's "after receipt before
//! watermark advance": the host writes the receipt and the acknowledged
//! watermark in **one** transaction ([`advance_watermark_for`] runs inside the
//! receipt's own transaction), so there is no instant between them to stand
//! in. The journal observer therefore runs after commit and parks only once the
//! target has both an acknowledging receipt and a contiguous watermark. A life
//! killed there leaves both durable.
//!
//! # No sleeps, and no marker polling
//!
//! The parent blocks on a socket the child attaches before its journey starts.
//! One byte means "fsync'd my arrival and parked on the boundary"; end of
//! stream means "died without reaching it". Both ends of that blocking read are
//! terminal, and `recv_timeout` bounds it with a deadline rather than a poll
//! interval. The child parks with [`std::thread::park`], never a timed sleep,
//! so no timing assumption can leak into where the kill lands.
//!
//! The one bounded wait that remains is convergence *after* recovery: the
//! delivery worker is asynchronous and durable, so the parent re-reads the
//! journal until it settles or the budget is spent. That is a liveness bound on
//! a real worker, not a synchronisation trick — nothing is assumed from the
//! passage of time, and a spent budget is a failure that prints the journal.
