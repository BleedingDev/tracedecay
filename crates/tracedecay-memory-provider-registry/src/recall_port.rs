//! Production implementation of the application cognitive-recall port over
//! the product provider composition.
//!
//! The port owns the direction of authority end to end:
//!
//! * the exact coding scope is derived by the host-supplied
//!   [`ExactScopeBinding`] from the application's resolved scope — never from
//!   anything a provider returns — and the composition root is the only place
//!   that implements the binding, so one derivation of `agent_session_id`
//!   exists;
//! * the application deadline is carried into the provider call unchanged,
//!   and the caller's *live* cancellation identity — the host-owned
//!   [`CancellationSignal`] whose token id the request names — is bridged
//!   into one [`CancellationToken`] that every handshake, call, and pinned
//!   fallback call of that recall shares. The adapter never mints a
//!   replacement identity: a signal whose token id differs from the request's
//!   is refused, and cancellation requested *after* dispatch reaches the
//!   provider through the token it is already holding. A request that is
//!   already cancelled or past its deadline is answered with a typed
//!   degradation without contacting the provider, and a recall whose
//!   cancellation fired or whose deadline elapsed *while* the provider was
//!   working is answered with that same typed degradation rather than with
//!   the provider's late reply: a provider that ignored the token it was
//!   handed cannot publish advisory content for a request its caller has
//!   already withdrawn;
//! * every provider reply is passed through rank-final
//!   [`admit_recall_reply`], so a candidate that fails exact-scope, identity,
//!   validity, or revocation checks can only reach the caller as a row in the
//!   [`RecallAdmissionReport`] ledger, never as advisory content;
//! * non-success terminals and fabric errors are typed: lane degradations
//!   (`deadline_exceeded`, `cancelled`, `provider_unavailable`,
//!   `capability_unsupported`, `capacity_exceeded`) become
//!   [`CognitiveRecallDegradation`], and a provider that rejects the host's
//!   own scope is an error, never an empty success;
//! * admitted candidates are normalized and then *selected* before anything
//!   becomes advisory content: host-owned exact deduplication and budget
//!   selection ([`select_recall_candidates`]) run on every mounted recall, so
//!   the same memory returned twice can never consume the result budget
//!   twice, and the complete selection receipt — including why each dropped
//!   candidate was dropped — travels with the outcome. A normalization that
//!   does not describe the admitted slice is a typed refusal, never a
//!   silently unpruned stream;
//! * provider selection is the host's [`ActiveRoutingPolicy`], never a
//!   provider name baked into the port: the pinned provider must be
//!   registered active under the pinned revision with the recall capability
//!   or the request is refused before any contact, and a fallback directive
//!   is honoured only under the identical host-pinned rule. Every result —
//!   complete, degraded before contact, or degraded by a terminal — carries
//!   the [`CognitiveRecallProviderIdentity`] of the provider it is attributed
//!   to, and Native facts are never an implicit fallback target.
//!
//! The application port trait returns only [`CognitiveRecallResult`]; the
//! admission report is returned alongside it by
//! [`ProjectCognitiveRecallPortV1::recall_admitted`] and observed through the
//! [`RecallAdmissionObserver`] the composition root installs.
