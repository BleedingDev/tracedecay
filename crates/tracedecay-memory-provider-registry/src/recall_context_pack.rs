//! Host-owned bridge from selected provider recall candidates into the
//! canonical token-budgeted context pack.
//!
//! Selection ([`crate::recall_selection`]) decided *which* admitted
//! candidates are still distinct evidence. This module is the last stage
//! before anything reaches an agent: it compiles required host evidence and
//! the advisory provider contribution into one pack under an explicit token
//! budget, measured with the canonical tokenizer, and emits a deterministic
//! pack receipt.
//!
//! Four properties are load-bearing, and each is enforced here rather than
//! documented and hoped for:
//!
//! * **The budget is measured, never estimated.** Every item's cost is the
//!   exact `o200k_base` BPE token count of its content
//!   ([`CANONICAL_CONTEXT_TOKENIZER_ID`]). A tokenizer that declares any
//!   other identity or revision is refused with
//!   [`ContextPackError::TokenizerNotCanonical`]; a byte-, character-, or
//!   word-count stand-in cannot be substituted silently, because a pack
//!   compiled under a different counter would carry a budget claim the host
//!   never verified.
//! * **Required host evidence cannot be evicted by provider volume.**
//!   Sections are compiled in priority order and every required section
//!   ([`ContextSectionKind::is_required`]) is placed *before* one advisory
//!   provider token is spent. Provider items compete only for what remains,
//!   and only up to the policy's advisory quota, which is itself bounded
//!   strictly below the total budget. No quantity of provider candidates can
//!   displace, truncate, or reorder code truth, safety evidence, session
//!   evidence, or Native facts. Required evidence that genuinely does not fit
//!   the configured total is a typed
//!   [`ContextPackError::RequiredEvidenceDoesNotFit`], never a silent drop.
//! * **Provenance survives compilation.** Every pack item keeps its section
//!   and a typed [`ContextItemProvenanceV1`]: host items name the host
//!   authority that produced them, provider items name the provider, the
//!   registration revision the reply was admitted under, the request-scoped
//!   candidate id, and the candidate's own provenance state — including the
//!   explicit "unknown" state, which is never collapsed into an empty label.
//! * **The pack is reconcilable and deterministic.** Every provider item of
//!   the contribution appears exactly once, either in the advisory section or
//!   in [`ContextPackV1::excluded_provider_items`] with a typed reason, so a
//!   pack can always be reconciled against its input. The
//!   [`ContextPackV1::pack_hash`] binds the policy identity, the tokenizer
//!   identity, the budgets, and every admitted item's section, identity,
//!   provenance, measured token cost, and content digest: identical inputs
//!   under an identical policy always produce an identical hash, and any
//!   change to what was admitted or to what it cost changes it.
//!
//! **An advisory item is admitted whole or not at all.** Provider content is
//! never truncated mid-item to fill a remaining token gap: half a recalled
//! memory is a different claim from the whole one, and a truncated advisory
//! sentence is exactly the kind of silently corrupted evidence this stage
//! exists to prevent. An item that does not fit is excluded and recorded.
