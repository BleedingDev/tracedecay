//! Host-owned execution boundary for synchronous provider work.
//!
//! Provider ports are synchronous: a recall reads a store on the calling
//! thread. The host still has to answer its caller at the caller's deadline —
//! or the moment the caller withdraws — and a provider that ignores both must
//! not be able to take the route down with it.
//!
//! # What the boundary actually controls
//!
//! Rust cannot stop a thread that is executing non-cooperative code. So the
//! boundary does not claim to terminate work it has no primitive for. Instead
//! it makes the *execution capability* an explicit, declared input and then
//! holds each provider to what that capability can honestly deliver:
//!
//! * The host supplies the worker capability
//!   ([`ProviderWorkerSpawnV1`]) and declares its
//!   [`ProviderWorkerIsolationV1`]. A `Terminable` host owns a real kill
//!   primitive — a supervised provider process is the intended shape — and
//!   [`ProviderWorkerHandleV1::terminate`] stops the worker without the
//!   provider's cooperation. A `CooperativeOnly` host runs the provider inside
//!   the host's own address space and has no such primitive.
//! * Each invocation declares the [`ProviderExecutionShapeV1`] of the code it
//!   is about to run. Foreign provider code is **refused before contact**
//!   ([`ProviderInvocationFaultV1::ExecutionNotIsolated`]) on a
//!   `CooperativeOnly` host: code the host did not write, cannot terminate,
//!   and cannot hold to a cancellation contract is not admitted at all. Only
//!   host-authored in-process code — the adapters this workspace compiles and
//!   is accountable for — runs on a non-terminable worker.
//! * Deadline **and** caller cancellation are raced against worker completion
//!   ([`ProviderInvocationBoundaryV1::invoke`]). Whichever fires first ends
//!   the caller's wait immediately; the caller never waits out a blocking
//!   provider after withdrawing.
//! * When the wait ends without an outcome the boundary asks the host to
//!   terminate the worker. A `Terminated` worker is proven gone: its slot is
//!   released, the provider is immediately routable again, and none of that
//!   needed the provider's cooperation. A worker the host cannot terminate is
//!   recorded as **stranded** — still running, no longer waited on, and
//!   published in [`ProviderInvocationBoundaryV1::worker_census`].
//! * Strands are finite and, on a `CooperativeOnly` host, deliberately scarce.
//!   A provider that owns
//!   [`ProviderInvocationLimitsV1::max_stranded_workers`] stranded workers is
//!   refused before contact ([`ProviderInvocationFaultV1::ProviderStalled`])
//!   until they return. That refusal is not a formality: a synchronous
//!   provider call holds its registration's serialized dispatch gate for as
//!   long as it runs, so admitting a second call would strand a second thread
//!   on the gate rather than reach the provider. Live workers are bounded
//!   independently ([`ProviderInvocationFaultV1::WorkerCapacityExhausted`]),
//!   so the threads one provider can occupy are bounded by
//!   `max_workers + max_stranded_workers` and never by an unbounded queue.
//!
//! # The honest limit
//!
//! On a `CooperativeOnly` host, a provider whose work *truly* never returns
//! leaves its route refused until that work returns. No accounting can undo
//! that: the work owns a host thread and the registration's dispatch gate, and
//! nothing in this process can take either back. That is precisely why foreign
//! code is not admitted there at all, and why the fix for a provider that can
//! hang is `Terminable` isolation — a supervised provider process — rather
//! than a larger strand allowance. With a `Terminable` host the same hang
//! costs one killed worker and the route is usable again immediately.
//!
//! Everything the boundary reports is derived from what actually happened to
//! the worker: a settled worker releases its slot, a terminated worker
//! releases it on the host's guarantee, and a stranded one releases the last
//! of its accounting when it finally returns.
