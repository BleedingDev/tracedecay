//! Transient-noise detection with byte spans.
//!
//! `tracedecay_runtime_core::memory::hygiene::detect_transient` answers whether
//! a string looks transient, which is all the curation planner needs. Redacting
//! a span needs the span, and the upstream span finder is crate-internal, so
//! this module owns the four transient patterns.
//!
//! This is deliberate, bounded duplication of exactly four expressions, kept
//! here rather than reached for upstream because reaching for it would mean
//! moving roughly two thousand lines of the shared privacy corpus across a
//! crate boundary. FOLLOW-UP: unify the two transient corpora behind one public
//! span-returning surface in `tracedecay-runtime-core` once the upstream patch
//! budget allows the extraction; `transient_corpus_matches_runtime_core` in
//! `tests/transient_evidence.rs` keeps the two in agreement until then.
//!
//! Two of the four classes deliberately never rewrite bytes. Ordinary code
//! facts routinely document a bind address ("the dashboard binds
//! `127.0.0.1:8080`") or describe timing ("the incremental pass finished in
//! 12.4s"), so ports and run-log phrasing are annotated and left alone. Only
//! unambiguous instance data — a process identifier, and a temporary path whose
//! final component is instance-shaped — is rewritten.
