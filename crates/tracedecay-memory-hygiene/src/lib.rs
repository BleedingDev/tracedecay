//! The single admitted secret and transient-data hygiene pipeline for
//! TraceDecay provider observations.
//!
//! # Where this runs
//!
//! Sanitization happens once, at admission, **before** any digest, observation
//! identity, or idempotency key is derived:
//!
//! ```text
//!   canonical evidence (never mutated, never deleted)
//!         │  &Value
//!         ▼
//!   ObservationSanitizer::admit
//!         │
//!         ├── Withheld { reason, receipt_id, source_payload_sha256 }
//!         │      the journal advances its replay cursor past the event and
//!         │      persists a digests-only audit row; no payload is stored, no
//!         │      ProviderCall is built, so no terminal code is needed
//!         │
//!         └── Admitted { sanitized, receipt }
//!                │  digests, observation id, and idempotency key are derived
//!                │  from the SANITIZED payload; those bytes are appended to
//!                │  the journal and dispatched verbatim
//!                ▼
//!          ProviderCall::new(parts)?.with_sanitization(receipt)
//!                ▼
//!          MemoryFabric::deliver_observation → ProviderCall::validate()
//!                fails closed unless the receipt binds this exact payload
//! ```
//!
//! Ordering is the trap this seam exists to close. If a caller derived the
//! idempotency key before admission, the key would name the pre-sanitization
//! digest while the payload carried the post-sanitization one, and a provider
//! would see two keys for one logical event. [`ObservationSanitizer::admit`]
//! therefore returns the sanitized value itself, and
//! [`canonical_payload_bytes`] is the one encoding every digest in this flow is
//! taken over.
//!
//! # What it never does
//!
//! [`ObservationSanitizer::admit`] takes a shared reference and returns a new
//! owned value. It holds no store handle, has no delete path, and cannot reach
//! canonical evidence. A transient detection in the root payload can at most
//! rewrite a span inside the provider-bound copy. An opaque extension is never
//! rewritten: if one would need mutation, [`ObservationSanitizer::admit_observation`]
//! withholds the whole provider-bound observation instead. Neither path can
//! remove anything canonical.
//!
//! No matched byte, redacted value, or source text enters a finding, a receipt,
//! a receipt identifier, or an error raised from this crate. That includes an
//! object key which is itself credential material: the key is replaced by an
//! opaque marker as the walk descends, so it cannot reach the location of a
//! finding on any value nested beneath it either.
//!
//! # Where the rules come from
//!
//! The credential corpus has exactly one owner. This crate reuses
//! `tracedecay_runtime_core`'s public detectors rather than re-deriving them,
//! because two divergent gitleaks catalogues is precisely the failure this
//! pipeline exists to prevent. What that public surface cannot do is enumerate
//! *every* class one string carries — `detect_secret_like` answers with the
//! first pattern that matched — so [`crate::credentials`] runs a bounded
//! multi-signal pass declared by the policy document, which can only ever add
//! reject-floor classes. See that module for why each signal exists.
//!
//! The class-to-action table is
//! [`OBSERVATION_HYGIENE_POLICY_V1_JSON`]: a byte-identical crate-local copy of
//! `product/observations/observation-hygiene-policy-v1.json`, embedded so this
//! crate compiles and packages inside its own ownership area, with the two
//! copies gated against each other from Python.
