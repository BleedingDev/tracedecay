#![cfg(unix)]
//! tdmem-0508: crash safety at every boundary between the host commit and the
//! durable provider acknowledgement.
//!
//! # A life is a real process, and it is really killed
//!
//! Every journey here runs the *real* runtime seam — [`IngressRuntimeV1`] over
//! a file-backed [`SqliteObservationJournal`], the wake edge, then
//! [`DeliveryRuntimeV1`] over a provider whose effects live in their own file.
//! The life that dies runs in a **child process** re-executed from this test
//! binary. It reaches one named boundary, records its arrival in a durable
//! marker file, and then parks; the parent observes the marker and sends
//! `SIGKILL`. Nothing is unwound: no destructor runs, the SQLite connection is
//! never closed, the WAL is never checkpointed, and the parent asserts the
//! child really died on signal 9.
//!
//! Recovery then happens in a *different* process — the parent — which opens
//! the same canonical stream, the same journal, and the same provider ledger
//! from disk and drives them to convergence. Nothing crosses the process
//! boundary in memory: not the replay position, not the lease, not the
//! provider's effect set. What comes back is what the three files hold.
//!
//! # The six boundaries, and where each hook actually sits
//!
//! | boundary | hook site |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | canonical commit → outbox write | inside `append_admitted`, *before* the inner journal transaction, for the target sequence |
//! | outbox write → enqueue | inside `append_admitted`, *after* the inner transaction committed and before `ingest` reaches `wake.signal()` |
//! | enqueue → provider receive | first statement of `deliver`, before the provider sees the bytes |
//! | provider receive → provider commit → ack return | inside `deliver`, immediately after the provider's effect is fsync'd and before the terminal is returned |
//! | ack return → ack persistence | inside `record_attempt`, before the inner journal transaction |
//! | after ack persistence | inside `record_attempt`, immediately after the inner transaction committed |
//!
//! Each hook fires at most once per life and the parent asserts the marker file
//! holds exactly one arrival, so a hook that is deleted, moved, or never
//! reached fails the test rather than degrading into a healthy run.
//!
//! # Why the canonical stream is its own file
//!
//! The host's canonical authority settles first and the observation pipeline
//! follows. If the "committed" stream lived only in the parent's memory, the
//! before-outbox case would have nothing durable to recover *from* and the
//! no-loss claim would be vacuous. So the canonical stream is an append-only
//! fsync'd file the child commits to **before** the pipeline runs, and every
//! restarted life discovers what to replay by reading that file back. The
//! expected stream is never handed to recovery as an argument.
//!
//! # Why the provider ledger is a file of lines
//!
//! A provider that deduplicates on the idempotency key is the only thing that
//! makes redelivery safe, so the harness models one honestly: it appends one
//! line per committed effect and dedupes by reading its own file back. A second
//! effect for the same mutation is therefore a second *line*, not something a
//! `HashSet` quietly absorbs — which is what lets AC3 be checked by counting
//! rather than by trusting the harness.
