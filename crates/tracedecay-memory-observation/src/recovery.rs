//! Restart recovery: what the outbox knows against what the provider claims.
//!
//! After a host or provider restart the two sides of a delivery can disagree in
//! exactly three ways, and each one has a different correct answer:
//!
//! * the provider is **behind** the journal — unacknowledged rows exist and the
//!   answer is redelivery, which is safe because the idempotency key is derived
//!   from content, so a provider that already applied a row answers
//!   `duplicate_acknowledged` instead of applying it twice;
//! * the provider's **state identity moved** — its state schema changed, or its
//!   generation went backwards because someone restored or reset it — and the
//!   answer is a typed repair requirement, never a silent reinitialization that
//!   would replay acknowledged history into a provider that already forgot it;
//! * the provider claims a position the journal **never journalled**, which no
//!   automatic action can reconcile and which therefore ends at an operator.
//!
//! # What makes the acknowledged sequence monotonic
//!
//! [`AcknowledgedPositionV1`] is not derived at read time from delivery rows: a
//! privacy deletion or a retention sweep legitimately removes an acknowledged
//! row, and a derived maximum would then move backwards and re-propose
//! delivered work. It is a durable watermark written inside the same
//! transaction as the acknowledging receipt, and the only statement that
//! touches it refuses to lower it.
//!
//! # What bounds the repair path
//!
//! [`RecoveryBudgetV1`] bounds how many times a host may re-attempt automatic
//! recovery against one incompatible provider state. Past it the assessment is
//! [`RecoveryPlanV1::OperatorRepairRequired`], which proposes no further
//! automatic action and names the exact repair an operator must perform. A
//! converged assessment clears the counter, so a provider that recovers is not
//! held against its history.
